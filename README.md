# pix2pix
This repository contains implementation of Conditional GAN model for images modality translation, described in [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks (Isola et al. 2016)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf)

Good pi2pix datasets can be downloaded from [here](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/pix2pix/datasets/) (train.py already contains code for downloading facades/maps datasets)

pix2pix_facades.ipynb contains training on facades dataset for 800 epochs
